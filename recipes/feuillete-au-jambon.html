    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Feuilleté au jambon is a classic French pastry dish that translates to
      "puff pastry with ham." I learnt how to make this dish from my girlfriend.
      The dish is typically made with puff pastry. The pastry is filled with a
      mixture of diced mushrooms, ham, cheese, and béchamel sauce, which is a
      white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk. The filling is then wrapped
      in the puff pastry and baked until golden brown and crispy. The result is
      a savory and satisfying pastry that is perfect for a light lunch or
      dinner.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pack of puff pasty</li>
      <li>1 cup of diced wild mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 cup diced ham</li>
      <li>1 cup of grated cheese (Cheddar or Gruyere)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of flour</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>Salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).</li>
      <li>
        Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a thickness of about
        1/4 inch (6mm).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the puff pastry into rectangles or squares of your desired size,
        usually 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) wide.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the béchamel sauce
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and
            whisk constantly for 2-3 minutes to make a roux.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slowly pour in the milk, whisking constantly, until the mixture is
            smooth and thick. Add salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        Add the diced mushrooms, diced ham, and grated cheese to the béchamel
        sauce, and stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon the ham and cheese mixture onto one half of each puff pastry
        rectangle, leaving a little bit of space around the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the edges of the puff pastry with a beaten egg, and then fold the
        other half of the pastry over the filling. Use a fork to press the edges
        together and seal the pastry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the tops of the pastries with more beaten egg to give them a
        golden brown color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the pastries on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and
        bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastries are puffed and golden
        brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the feuilleté au jambon from the oven and let them cool for a few
        minutes before serving.
      </li>
      <p>
        With a salad or soup, enjoy your delicious feuilleté au jambon. Bon
        appétit!
