      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Egusi soup is a traditional dish from Nigeria. I grew up eating this
        delicious meal with my family. The soup is known for its rich, nutty
        flavor and creamy texture. Made with ground melon seeds (also known as
        egusi), which are first toasted and then cooked with a variety of
        spices, fish, meat and vegetables. Egusi soup is a hearty and comforting
        meal that is enjoyed by many people throughout West Africa and beyond.
