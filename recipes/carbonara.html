    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>500g of whole wheat spaghetti</li>
      <li>4 large farmers eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>250 grams pancetta or bacon, diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook
        until al dente, according to package instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the spaghetti is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high
        heat. Add the diced pancetta or bacon and cook until crispy, stirring
        occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes, until
        fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the spaghetti is done cooking, reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta
        water and then drain the spaghetti.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta or bacon and
        garlic. Toss everything together to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the skillet from the heat and immediately pour in the egg and
        Parmesan mixture. Use tongs or a fork to quickly toss everything
        together until the spaghetti is coated in a creamy sauce. If the sauce
        seems too thick, add a little bit of the reserved pasta water to thin it
        out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the Carbonara pasta with salt and freshly ground black pepper to
        taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the Carbonara pasta hot, garnished with additional grated Parmesan
        cheese and freshly cracked black pepper, if desired.
