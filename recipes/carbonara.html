    <h2>Carbonara Pasta</h2>
    <p>
      This is one my favorite types of pasta. Simple, fast and delicious.
      Carbonara pasta is a classic Italian dish that is beloved around the world
      for its creamy, rich flavor and satisfying texture. The dish is made with
      a few simple ingredients, including spaghetti, eggs, pancetta or bacon,
      and Parmesan cheese, all of which come together to create a flavorful and
      hearty meal. To make carbonara pasta, the pancetta or bacon is first
      saut√©ed until crispy, then mixed with eggs and Parmesan cheese to create a
      velvety sauce that coats the strands of spaghetti. The dish is typically
      finished with a generous sprinkle of black pepper, which adds a bold,
      spicy kick to the creamy sauce. Whether enjoyed as a comforting weeknight
      dinner or a decadent special occasion meal, carbonara pasta is a timeless
      classic that is sure to please any pasta lover.
